									<p>I'm a first year student at the <a href="https://unc.edu"><strong>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</strong></a> intending to major in computer science. This is a bit about myself.</p>

									<h2 class="major">I'm a musician.</h2>
									<p>I started learning the piano at around age five and picked up the violin as I entered the middle school. It's a lot harder to find time and space to practice now in college, but I still try to squeeze it in where I can and am always missing the keyboard that I left at home.</p>
									<p>Apart from classical instruments, I make digital covers of music from anime and video game series, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_N_XgCHJug">this instrumental cover</a>. I've also tried my hand at Vocaloid, a Japanese computer-synthesized vocal application, in covering others' songs - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijLJRsW6ps4">like this one</a>.</p>

									<h2 class="major">I'm a coder.</h2>
									<p>Being a millenial, I've always been surrounded in my life by computers. They can be found built into so many things nowadays - even in places where one wouldn't even care to look. That's why I chose to study computer science - because it's so useful in so many fields and has so many applications - and that's also why I love to code things.</p>
									<p>I'm fairly active on GitHub, a site for open-source projects to publish themselves and attract others to contribute code and patches. I'm a maintainer for the <a href="https://caskroom.github.io">Homebrew-Cask</a> package manager for the macOS operating system, and I submit patches to its sister/parent project as well, <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> proper.</p>

									<h2 class="major">I'm a videographer.</h2>
									<p>I enjoy using video as a storytelling or expository medium, and am always interested in learning new techniques, both in the processes of actual filming and also post-production. I have also produced videos for my church as well as a robotics team in high school. It's often challenging to find some kind of content or styling to match what I'm trying to make, but the experience is nonetheless rewarding and exciting to me.</p>
